While a student at the Dev Mountain boot camp in Provo, I came up with the unoriginal idea of creating a random generator for my personal project using AngularJS.  It was a lot of fun worked perfectly but the finished product that I turned in was very clunky, not very responsive, and the UI wasn't very convenient.
See it at https://github.com/caulkerman/Personal-Project-Random-Generator

This newest project, named The Randomizer, is a definate improvement of the previous project, it is fully responsive, and is simply, simply more usable.

The Randomizer allows the user to input categories such as "Places to Eat", or "People to Drug Test".  The user then clicks either the Raffle Style Randomizer or the Infinity Style Randomizer buttons and then selects the category of his/her choice.

Once the category has been clicked the user is taken to the style of Randomizer chosen where items can be added to the category.  When a sufficient number of items are entered the user can then start Randomizing by pressing the "Go" button.  An item is randomly chosen from the list and displayed for the user to see.


The Randomizer app has been created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB.

This app is completely of my own design.  I am a learning, Jr developer, and I have used the best practices that I currently know how.  Of course my knowledge is small but it will get better as I continue to create more web apps.
